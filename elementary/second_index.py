    of the second string in the first one.

    Let's go through the first example where you need to find the second occurrence of "s" in a word "sims".

    Itâ€™s easy to find its first occurrence with a function index or find which will point out that "s"
    is the first symbol in a word "sims" and therefore the index of the first occurrence is 0.

    But we have to find the second "s" which is 4th in a row and that means that the index
    of the second occurrence (and the answer to a question) is 3.

    Input: Two strings.
    Output: Int or None

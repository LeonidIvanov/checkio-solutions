def checkio(number):
    """"Fizz buzz" is a word game we will use to teach the robots about division. Let's learn computers.

    You should write a function that will receive a positive integer and return:
    "Fizz Buzz" if the number is divisible by 3 and by 5;
    "Fizz" if the number is divisible by 3;
    "Buzz" if the number is divisible by 5;
    The number as a string for other cases.
    Input: A number as an integer.

    Output: The answer as a string.

    Precondition: 0 < number â‰¤ 1000
    """
    if number % 3 == 0 and number % 5 == 0:
        return "Fizz Buzz"
    elif number % 3 == 0:
        return "Fizz"
    elif number % 5 == 0:
        return "Buzz"
    else:
        return str(number)


if __name__ == '__main__':
    assert checkio(15) == "Fizz Buzz", "15 is divisible by 3 and 5"
    assert checkio(6) == "Fizz", "6 is divisible by 3"
    assert checkio(5) == "Buzz", "5 is divisible by 5"
    assert checkio(7) == "7", "7 is not divisible by 3 or 5"
